          constitutes protected know-how of the Principal. 10.4. In case an
          Individual Buyer’s Principal changes (e.g. if such Buyer is an
          employee who changes employers), Buyer updates his or her Profile

          BD’s Code of Conduct. 10.7. Unless an Individual Buyer informs SQUARE
          FEET BD otherwise, SQUARE FEET BD assumes that all information on his
          or her Profile is the Individual Buyer’s own information or has been
          authorized by its Principal. SQUARE FEET BD may update such
          information in accordance with Section 11. 11. Subaccount Updates
          11.1. Member hereby agrees that SQUARE FEET BD may, on behalf of
          Member, update information on Member’s Profile, if Member directly

          complements, obviously contradicts, or is more up-to-date than,
          current information on Member’s Profile (e.g. if Member supplied a new
          version of a manufacturing certificate or informs SQUARE FEET BD of
          additional equipment bought). 11.2. SQUARE FEET BD may access public
          registers (such as the commercial register, customs information,
          information provided by non-governmental organizations or databases
          concerning compliance certificates), or request information from third
          party providers (such as credit scoring agencies). SQUARE FEET BD may
          use such supplementary information to (i) complement or update a
          Member’s Profile, (ii) link such information to a Member’s Profile or
          (iii) validate the entries on a Member’s Profile visibly for other
          Members (for example, by adding a checkmark to such verified
          information). 11.3. SQUARE FEET BD may ask Members to correct, or
          directly correct, obviously wrongly information on a Member’s Profile

          SQUARE FEET BD is not obliged to provide such updates of Profiles.
          Member may inform SQUARE FEET BD if such information is incorrect and
          SQUARE FEET BD will reverse the changes in due time. 12. Liability of

          willful intent and gross negligence and any harm to body, life and

          representatives or other assistants. For slight negligence SQUARE FEET
          BD shall be liable only in case of infringement of essential
          contractual obligations. The liability in case of infringement of such
          essential contractual obligation shall be limited to the damages
          typical for the contract which SQUARE FEET BD should have expected
          when entering into the agreement due to the circumstances known to
          SQUARE FEET BD at that time. 12.2. The limitations on liability set
          out above shall apply accordingly to SQUARE FEET BD’s employees and

          databases or services nor for its contents. In particular, SQUARE FEET
          BD shall not be liable for the legality, accuracy and completeness of
          such third party services. 12.4. To the extent the Platform
          incorporates information from third party providers, SQUARE FEET BD

          of such databases or services, nor for their contents. 13. Third Party
          Contents, Data Security, Confidentiality 13.1. The Members must not
          publish content which infringes statutory provisions, official orders

          third parties. 13.2. Except as set out in Section 11, SQUARE FEET BD
          does not review content provided by the Members to the Platform and
          declines any responsibility for such content. 13.3. SQUARE FEET BD
          reserves the right to remove any contents if such content violates the

          parties. 13.4. The Member holds SQUARE FEET BD harmless against all

          implements economically reasonable measures to reduce downtimes of the
          Platform to a minimum. However, as any technical system, there can be

          etc. The Member is responsible for the implementation of measures to
          ensure that temporary downtime does not affect the Member’s business
          operations. 13.7. SQUARE FEET BD keeps all information provided by its
          Members and which is designated as confidential information strictly
          confidential and only uses such information in accordance with these

          lawfully known by SQUARE FEET BD at the time of receipt and not
          through a prior disclosure by SQUARE FEET BD, b. is at the time of
          disclosure or thereafter becomes published or otherwise part of the
          public domain without breach of this agreement by SQUARE FEET BD, or
          c. is substantially disclosed to SQUARE FEET BD by a third party who
          is not under an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of the
          information. SQUARE FEET BD uses high encryption standards to ensure
          confidentiality of critical data provided to SQUARE FEET BD. SQUARE
          FEET BD has the right to disclose information in case and to the
          extent SQUARE FEET BD is legally obliged to. 13.8. The content
          provided by Members on the Platform is accessible to other Members of
          the Platform. SQUARE FEET BD does not make such content accessible to
          third parties which are not Members of the Platform except (i) in
          order to provide the Platform’s information and invitation
          functionalities as provided for under Section 7, or (ii) in case
          SQUARE FEET BD assigns essentially all parts of the Platform to a
          third party or (iii) in case SQUARE FEET BD uses such content for
          references or advertisements as set out in Section 8.2. However,
          Members are aware that SQUARE FEET BD cannot prevent other Members of
          the Platform from sharing such content with third parties. 14. Term
          14.1. The initial term starts with the acceptance of the subscription
          agreement according to Section 5. The term of the subscription is
          unlimited, unless terminated as detailed below. 14.2. In case of a
          subscription model without fees, a Member can terminate its
          subscription at any time without cause by deleting his or her account
          or sending SQUARE FEET BD an email. Due to technical reasons, it may
          take up to thirty (30) days until Member’s profile is fully deleted
          from the Platform and not visible to other Members anymore after such
          termination. 14.3. In case of a subscription model based on fees,
          Member can terminate its subscription without cause to the end of each
          month with a one month’s period of notice. 14.4. Each party shall have
          the right to terminate this agreement for good cause without a notice
          period. A good cause for SQUARE FEET BD is in particular: a. the
          breach of provisions of these Terms and Conditions or the Code of
          Conduct by a Member (or, in case of Individual Buyer acting for a
          Principal, a false warrant regarding the Principal’s fulfilment of the
          Code of Conduct), which are not remedied within a deadline set; b.
          criminal activities by a Member or the attempt of such criminal
          activities, for example fraud; c. if the Member is in default of
          payment as regards the payment to be made pursuant to Section 5 for
          more than six weeks; d. long-term operational disruptions as a result
          of force majeure beyond the control of SQUARE FEET BD, such as natural
          disasters or fire. 14.5. The notice of termination must be made in
          writing, or, if available, by using the termination procedure in the
          Member’s account area on the Platform. Transmission by e-mail is
          sufficient. 14.6. In case the Member payed subscription fees in
          advance, the statutory provisions about refunds shall apply. 15.
          Amendment of the Terms and Conditions for Use 15.1. SQUARE FEET BD
          shall inform the Member of amendments of these terms and conditions in
          writing, by fax, by e-mail or by a message displayed to Members when
          logging in to the Platform. If the Member does not object to such
          amendments within a period of two weeks after receipt of the notice,
          the amendments shall be deemed agreed. SQUARE FEET BD shall inform the
          Members separately of their right of objection and the legal
          consequences of silence in case of amendment of the terms and
          conditions. 15.2. If the Member objects to the amendment of the terms
          and conditions, SQUARE FEET BD has the right to terminate the
          subscription agreement with two weeks’ notice. 16. Law and Venue 16.1.
